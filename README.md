This reposetory can help you if you become a victim of an log attack or made an error while working with logs.
Recently I've made minecraft server monitoring but aftr all I accidentally opened my monitoring two times in a row and it filled my disk fully, it was close to deleting system but i could save my system by vacuuming log files.

## Warning
This programm can be used by you by your own risk as it can doesnt help in case of real DDoS or other problem.
But you can use it in case of neccesity of re-strapping, nothing more.

## Also its just pet-project and I want to perfect it in near future!
